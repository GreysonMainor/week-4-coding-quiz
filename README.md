# week-4-coding-quiz
The purpose of this code is to create a user responsive quiz using javascript.  I attempted this assignment in order to help further my understanding of javascript and its relation with other elements on the page.  I also needed to get a firmer grasp on each of the functions as well as how to properly execute certain commands through javascript.  This code works by accepting user input through clicks on different options and returning them with a correct or incorrect variable.  This quiz is also constantly monitored by time to ensure quick responses as well as keep up the pace.  Score is attributed to each question and is returned at the end of the quiz.  This code should also make use of local storage in order to keep track of user scores as well as their initials.  This project helped me learn a lot about arrays as well as the relationship between all 3 coding languages.
